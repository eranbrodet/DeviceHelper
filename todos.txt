Bugs:
- If filename contains spaces than Device.action() doesn't work correctly (it splits by spaces)
- Input only stops before doing the app specific login
- Logs abort is shown when no logs (had logs before)
- Retaking focus after the popups doesn't always work right
- UI only updates after synchronous operations (which make the window be stuck)
- Escape adb text chars (http://stackoverflow.com/a/31371987/2134702)

Important improvements:
- Shouldn't be able to start another session without canceling previous one
- Add signapk button
- _common_post should be automated
- Ability to cancel when running system command (and not just from popup)

Unimportant improvements:
- Apply default folder for everything (app, logs, screenshots, etc.)
- viewclient uses uiautomator shell command to read screen
- better ui (pyqt is annoying for not being able to use exceptions, but maybe work with that or just improve on the current)
- Document dependencies in adb,appt etc. and maybe try to do without dependency ('requests' at the moment)
- clear logs area button
- Global handling of crashes (writing a log file or something, also when config json is invalid show popup or something)
- Better separation of apps, sdks, configs. maybe everything should be checkboxes and there should be a play/abort button instead of buttons for sdks)
- Choose folder and list files
- Clear file selection
- Rename project to something cool
- Detect devices connnect/disconnect automatically
- auto detect sdk (with check flavours although that's a bit too specific a dependency)? 

Unkowns:
- What happens if switching devices during command?
