_common_post should be automated
Add tab for free text input and maybe "good only get key"
Document dependencies in adb,appt etc.
What happens if switching devices during command?
logs abort is shown when no logs (had logs before)
apply default folder for everything (app, logs, screenshots, etc.)
clear logs area button
Global handling of crashes (writing a log file or something, also when config json is invalid show popup or something)
Retake focus
Move everything that shouldn't be committed to config file
upgrade detection system
Update ui before synchronous operations
escape adb text chars (http://stackoverflow.com/a/31371987/2134702)

better separation of apps, sdks, configs. maybe everything should be checkboxes and there should be a play/abort button instead of buttons for sdks)
Choose folder and list files
Clear file selection
Ability to cancel when running system command (and not just from popup)
Auto selecting devices might mean that if a device disconnected mid way, the run will try to continue on another device?

rename project to something cool
Detect devices connnect/disconnect automatically
auto detect sdk (with check flavours)?
Redo it in C# ?
